The great land of the Forgotten Semicolon has always been ruled by the Squaron people, and lived in harmony with he Trianglons. Recently, however, the Trianglons have been attacking the villages of the Squaron people. Help the great king clear the land and win the war !

Everything was made by us except the music.

A much needed fix was added after the voting period ended. The pause menu was fixed and a game breaking bug was fixed.
